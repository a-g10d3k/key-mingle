# key-mingle
A lightweight CLI key-mapping utility for Windows.

## Installation
Simply extract the .exe file from the archive and you're ready to go!

(I reccomend extracting it into a separate folder, because the software creates a .dat file to keep your key configuration.)

## Quick guide
key-mingle allows you to map any key on your keyboard to any other key.
For example if you mapped your "A" key to your "B" key, every time you press "B" on your keyboard it will instead be 
registered as "A".

#### How to map keys:
1. Press "a" in the main menu, you will be prompted to press the first key (in our case it's "B").
2. After you press the first key, you will be prompted to press the second one (in our case it's "A").
3. Now you just need to press "s". The "A" key will be now mapped to the "B" key until you close the program.

You can also save your key configuration by pressing "o" in the main menu.

#### How to remove keys:
1. Press "r" in the main menu.
2. Select a pair of keys using up and down arrows/
3. Press enter to remove the selected pair of keys.
4. Press escape to return to the main menu.

#### Additional notes:
- You can delete your key configuration by deleting the key-mingle.dat file.
- You can view all of your mapped keys by pressing "d" in the main menu.
